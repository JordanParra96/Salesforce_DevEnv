## Wiki Page

You can find in the Wiki page of this repository a set of best practices and tips that I have found on my way through Salesforce, this could help to facilitate the implementations and optimize the solutions, I invite you to take a look [Wiki Page](https://github.com/JordanParra96/Salesforce_DevEnv/wiki).

## CI Workflow

For this repository I implemented a CI flow in which validations are performed for both LWC code (using prettier and eslint) and Apex code (using prettier), in addition to this a validation of test classes is performed (both for LWC and apex) in which I try to ensure the quality of the code that is implemented and uploaded to the main branch, the complete implementation can be seen in the wiki `page in progress`.

## Codecov

Once the validation of the organization's code is done, the report of the status, coverage, lines covered, percentage, is uploaded to the codecov page ([codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)), the complete configuration and how to implement this can be found in the wiki `page in progress`.
